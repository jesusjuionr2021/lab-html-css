    <h2>Broholmer</h2>
    <p><em>The Danish Broholmer</em> is a dog that strongly resembles a <strong>Mastiff</strong>. It is large and powerful, with a loud, impressive bark and dominant walk. A well trained Broholmer should be calm, good tempered, and friendly, yet watchful towards strangers. Females stand about 27.5 inches (70 cm) and weigh in at 90–130 pounds (41–59 kg). Males stand about 29.5 inches (75 cm) and weigh in at 110–150 pounds (50–68 kg). The body is built square and rectangular with a large and massive head. The width and length of the skull and the length of the nose should be of equal length. The head is generally not carried very high. The coat is short and harsh, and the color can be light or brownish yellow, or black. Some white markings on the coat are permitted, and a black mask may be found. The average life span is around 7–12 years.</p>

    <h3>The Slash</h3>
    <p>Known as <strong>“the Slash,”</strong> this treeless zone is 20 feet wide and covers everything from narrow isolated islands to steep hillsides. Spanning national forests and towering mountains, the vast majority of the <em>Slash</em> is so remote that it will never receive any visitors (aside from a handful of bears), yet it is still painstakingly maintained every six years with grueling hours of exhausting manual labor.

      The Slash was initially deforested for the sole purpose of, according to the IBC, making sure that the “average person… knows they are on the border.” It all started in the 1800s, when the western land section of the U.S.–Canada border was set at the 49th parallel. The Slash was cut and over 8,000 original border markers were laid down, most of which are still standing along with it to this day.</p>

    <h4>Verrazano-Narrows Bride</h4>
    <p>The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge (/vərəˈzɑːnoʊ/ vər-ə-ZAH-noh; also referred to as the Verrazzano Bridge, locally as the <em>Verrazzano</em>, and formerly as the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge or Narrows Bridge) is a suspension bridge connecting the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn. It spans the Narrows, a body of water linking the relatively enclosed Upper New York Bay with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, and is the only fixed crossing of the Narrows. The double-deck bridge carries 13 lanes of Interstate 278, with seven lanes on the upper level and six on the lower level. The span is named for <strong>Giovanni da Verrazzano</strong>, the first documented European explorer to enter New York Harbor and the Hudson River in 1524.</p>
